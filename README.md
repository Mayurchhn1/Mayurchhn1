select customerfirstname, customerlastname from customer order by customerlastname desc
select customerfirstname, customerlastname from customer order by 4, 2, 3 desc  -- Order By Based on column no. without typing column name
-- Distinct: only show unique values
select distinct customerlastname from customer order by customerlastname

-- 7. Save table to another table
-- Into file_name: save result in another table (BASE TABLE)
select distinct customerlastname into temp from customer order by customerlastname
select * from temp -- see the table (data type will remain)

-- 8. Like (search something)
-- (Underscore sign) _ is only specific for one character only
-- (Percent sign) % represents zero, one, or multiple characters
select * from customer where customerlastname like '_r%'

-- 9. In (search something)
